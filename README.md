# Î¼Switch

Discord bot to find songs on different platforms.

Adds message context commands that find links to songs on supported platforms in the message, gets the song title and artist using the URLs, uses said title and artist to search on the selected platform, and sends back an ephemeral message containing links to the first search result of the songs.
